Discord Bots - Episode 10

Why Discord Bots?  Because they're cool, and actually they're really easy to do and can teach you a lot.  Most good languages already have libraries and APIs set up for Discord Bots which makes things super easy.

For these examples I shall be using Python but similar steps can be taken in JavaScript and if you're feeling a particular kind of crazy .. Java, I use Java.

Setting up a Discord Bot

As expected there are some hoops to jump through, not literally (I hate jumping), before you can get a Discord Bot up and running.  Firstly you need to sign into Discord and navigate to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and hit the "New Application" button, from here you should give your bot a witty name and finally select "Create".

After you've done this you need to scroll down and select "Add Bot User", this basically lets Discord know that you want to make a Bot and to provide the necessary stuff for you.
